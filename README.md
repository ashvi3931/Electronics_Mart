## Prerequisites
**xampp
phpmyadmin
A compatible IDE (e.g.Visual Studio Code)

## Setting Up Xampp Environment
To set up a XAMPP environment, first download the latest version from the Apache Friends website and install it on your system. Once installed, launch the XAMPP Control Panel and start the Apache and MySQL services. Configure any necessary settings through the Control Panel or by editing the configuration files. Finally, create your web files and place them in the 'htdocs' directory within the XAMPP installation directory to start developing and testing your web applications locally.

## Running the Project
To run a project in XAMPP, ensure that the Apache and MySQL services are running in the XAMPP Control Panel. Then, open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost/Appliances-Mart. If your project is in a subfolder within the 'htdocs' directory, include the subfolder name in the URL. Your project should now be accessible and running locally on your XAMPP server.
